This is task for MDG Bulgaria.

The application is based on 4 technologies:

We use MongoDB for the database ( NodeJS is working great with it) that we deployed on the cloud, Express for faster and more readable Node JS, Angular for the front-end SPA and NodeJS for the backend ( The well known MEAN stack ).

The MongoDB database is into MongoLabs. We use the free version of it that suits our needs for the demo.

The NodeJS is set on Heroku with their deployment kit. You can see it into node api folder. With its packages and Proc file. We use Express framework for it because it gave us much better readability.

In the front end we use HTML5, CSS3, Javascript ES5( to ES6 needs polyfill for most browsers ) and AngularJS.

There is Grunt and we have grunt file with which we can build the app but i dont think we need it

The Third-party libraries we use at the front-end are : Bootstrap, Jquery and Angular.

Every file is self documented.
